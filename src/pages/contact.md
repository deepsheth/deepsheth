Hi, I'm Arpit. I am an interdisciplinary engineer and designer based in New York City. ðŸ—½
I'm a Cornell University alum and a graduate of the Master of Engineering in Computer Science program at Cornell Tech.
I've worked on building products and leading teams in energetic, creative, and technical environments.
I recently founded my own company, [Crater](http://arpitsheth.com/#crater).

I love learning from people. It's the best way to get a diverse perspective on things.
Get in touch with me at **[shetharp@gmail.com](mailto:shetharp@gmail.com).** If you're
in the area, coffee is an option too! â˜•
