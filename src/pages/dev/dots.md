As a fun project, I created a web app to play a game of connect-the-dots.
I built it using a JavaScript library for the HTML5 Canvas [(FabricJS)](http://fabricjs.com/).

### [Play the Game](https://github.com/deepsheth/Connect-the-Dots)

You can [**play the game**](https://deepsheth.github.io/Connect-the-Dots/) right now (it works on your phone too), but be warned &mdash; it's addicting.
