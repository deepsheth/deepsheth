During my senior year at Lehigh, I took a course on Blockchain. We explored distributed consensus, cryptography, and business applications of distributed ledgers. I wrote a number of papers analyzing and exploring many of these topics.

Read my paper on a [**Spotify blockchain proposal**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qBWLx5wbk6VTRgIwP-Y4gN3onTA1bI7N), where I discuss a practical, real-world example of how a blockchain architecture can be used to benefit the music industry.

Another paper I wrote explores the [**regulatory concerns**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=109WvTtjYcP_ufhnUCO5S0hhgHExHZvjH) over cryptocurrencies and how blockchain plays an important role with it's controversial decentralized and pseudo-anonymous design.

My final paper gives a [**holistic overview**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bC1Nx1twdeQTYmOsPJXx_pL8aQLB8Is3) of what these emerging technologies mean for our society, exploring both the benefits and dangers.
