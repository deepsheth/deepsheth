In 2016, my friends and I participated in a weekend-long hackathon at Lehigh. Our focus was improving campus safety, so we built an app that helps people walk in groups instead of alone. You can find our project write-up on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/walk-with-me-1ayvfn), where we discuss our project in depth.
