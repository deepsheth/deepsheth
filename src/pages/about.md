Hi, I'm Arpit. I am an interdisciplinary engineer and designer based in New York City. 🗽
I'm a Cornell University alum and a graduate of the Master of Engineering in Computer Science program at Cornell Tech.
I've worked on building products and leading teams in energetic, creative, and technical environments.
I recently founded my own company, [Crater](/#crater).

_I've been teaching myself web development since 2008.
I built this website to practice my craft, playtest ideas, and learn from mistakes I might make along the way.
Please [share your thoughts](/contact) with me, or see what's [under the hood.](/colophon)_
