Hi, I'm Arpit. I am an interdisciplinary engineer and designer based in New York City. 🗽
I'm a Cornell University alum and a graduate from the Cornell Tech Master of Engineering program.
I've built products and led teams in energetic, creative, and technical environments.
Recently, I founded my own company, Crater.

_I've been teaching myself web development since 2008.
I built this website to practice my craft, iterate on ideas, and learn from potential mistakes along the way.
Please [share your thoughts](/contact) with me or see what's [under the hood.](/colophon)_
